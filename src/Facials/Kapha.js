    Skin appears smooth and healthy with a flawless and radiant complexion. The unpleasant shiny effect is eliminated.
     Production of sebum by oily and impure skin is normalised and the skin is less prone to irritations; the products also have an antibacterial effect. Tests have shown a 58% reduction in the production of sebum. Skin becomes flawless and purer with a finer and more homogeneous texture. 
    Antiseptic active principles of vegetable origin actively act against impurities and comedones.<br/>
